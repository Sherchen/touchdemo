A collection of concepts and techniques for implementing believable touch interactions.

_1.  Tension_

  Does your touch interaction have a pull resistance?  Does it snap back when released?
    
_2.  Inertia_

  Does it fling?  Does it preserve velocity?
    
_3.  Elasticity_

  Is it easy to stretch?
    
_4.  Boundary_

  Is there a threshold that it will not cross?
